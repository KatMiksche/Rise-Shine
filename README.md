Stock portfolio app

steps for installation:
1) rise-shine-SQL-setup.sql - required
2) DEMO data.sql - optional
3) change sql connection config details in RSSQL.py 
4) run tests in Test folder - optional
5) GUI.py - run the main file

if you require more info, check the full documentation:
https://github.com/KatMiksche/rise-shine/blob/main/Rise%26Shine%20-%20project%20documentation%20-%20final.pdf

please note that there are usually no 'help' comments for functions as the main run environment is GUI

enjoy :-)

PS: Coming to the end, I already know what could be done differently. For example heavier use of global variables. Next time...
