# rise-shine
Stock portfolio app

Steps for installation:
download whole repository
rise-shine-SQL-setup.sql - required
DEMO data.sql - optional
run tests in Test folder - optional
GUI.py - run the main file

if you require more info, check the Documentation folder

please note that there are usually no 'help' comments for functions as the main run environment is GUI

enjoy :-)

PS: Coming to the end, I already know what could be done differently. for example heavier use of global variables. Next time...
